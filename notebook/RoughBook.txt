SVG Path - <path>
The <path> element is used to define a path.

Paths are used to create simple or complex shapes combining several straight or curved lines.

The <path> element has one basic attribute that defines the points and other commands of how to draw the path:


Attribute	Description
d	Required. A set of commands which define the path.
The following commands are available for path data:

M = moveto (move from one point to another point)
L = lineto (create a line)
H = horizontal lineto (create a horizontal line)
V = vertical lineto (create a vertical line)
C = curveto (create a curve)
S = smooth curveto (create a smooth curve)
Q = quadratic Bézier curve (create a quadratic Bézier curve)
T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto (create a smooth quadratic Bézier curve)
A = elliptical Arc (create a elliptical arc)
Z = closepath (close the path)
Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed in lower case. Upper case means absolutely positioned, lower case means relatively positioned.


Example
<svg height="400" width="450" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

<!-- Draw the paths -->
<path id="lineAB" d="M 100 350 l 150 -300" stroke="red" stroke-width="4"/>
<path id="lineBC" d="M 250 50 l 150 300" stroke="red" stroke-width="4"/>
<path id="lineMID" d="M 175 200 l 150 0" stroke="green" stroke-width="4"/>
<path id="lineAC" d="M 100 350 q 150 -300 300 0" stroke="blue" stroke-width="4" fill="none"/>

<!-- Mark relevant points -->
<g stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="black">
<circle id="pointA" cx="100" cy="350" r="4" />
<circle id="pointB" cx="250" cy="50" r="4" />
<circle id="pointC" cx="400" cy="350" r="4" />
</g>

<!-- Label the points -->
<g font-size="30" font-family="sans-serif" fill="green" text-anchor="middle">
<text x="100" y="350" dx="-30">A</text>
<text x="250" y="50" dy="-10">B</text>
<text x="400" y="350" dx="30">C</text>
</g>
